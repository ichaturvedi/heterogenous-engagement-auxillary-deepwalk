Heterogenous Engagement Auxillary Deepwalk
===
This code implements the model discussed in Heterogenous Engagement Auxillary Deepwalk. Video engagement is important in online advertisements where there is no physical interaction with a user. Videos shown in the same channel are likely to have a similar reviewer rating, hence we use graph embeddings to identify YouTube advertisements that are fraud or genuinely popular.
